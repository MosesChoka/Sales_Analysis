You have three data sets, one for the central region, one for eastern, and one for the western region.  You may need to edit the code below for the path to the files.

```{r}
library(tidyr)
library(tidyverse)
#load from CSV
centralData <- read.csv("Orders_Central.csv", header=TRUE)
View(centralData)
westData <- read.csv("orders_west.csv", header=TRUE)
View(westData)
eastData <- read.delim("Orders_East.txt", header=TRUE, sep='\t')
```
For this project, answer the following questions, but please note: the data may or may not be setup such that you can just answer. You may need to perform some "data wrangling" before you can answer. Include the code you use for any wrangling/EDA in your submission.

# DATA WRANGLING
```{r}
# Look at the structure of the three datasets
# Central data
dim(centralData)
colnames(centralData)
View(centralData)

# West Data
dim(westData)
colnames(westData)

# East Data
dim(eastData)
colnames(eastData)
```

```{r}
# Remove duplicate values from the datasets
centralData <- unique(centralData)
westData <- unique(westData)
eastData <- unique(eastData)

# Check the resulting rows after removing duplicates
dim(centralData)
dim(westData)
dim(eastData)

```

East data had some duplicate regions. The rows number drop from 2846 to 2807 after taking only unique values.

```{r}
# Further inspection on the datasets column (Making the data consistent)

# A. Central Region
colnames(centralData)

# Create order date and ship date from the variables (Orde.Day, Order.Month ,...Ship.Day, Ship.Month, Ship.Year)

centralData <- centralData %>%
  unite("Order.Date", Order.Year, Order.Month, Order.Day, sep = "-")

centralData <- centralData %>%
  unite("Ship.Date", Ship.Year, Ship.Month, Ship.Day, sep = "-")

View(centralData)
class(centralData$Order.Date)

# Convert the Order and Shipping Dates to Date variable
centralData$Order.Date <- as.Date(centralData$Order.Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
centralData$Ship.Date <- as.Date(centralData$Ship.Date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")
class(centralData$Order.Date)

# B. West Region
# Remove the 0:00 from the order date and shipping date columns
westData$Order.Date <- sub(" [0-9:]+$", "", westData$Order.Date)
westData$Ship.Date <- sub(" [0-9:]+$", "", westData$Ship.Date)

# Convert to the Ship  and Order Dates to date
westData$Order.Date <- as.Date(westData$Order.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
westData$Ship.Date <- as.Date(westData$Ship.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

# C. East Region
# Remove the 0:00 from the order date and shipping date columns
eastData$Order.Date <- sub(" [0-9:]+$", "", eastData$Order.Date)
eastData$Ship.Date <- sub(" [0-9:]+$", "", eastData$Ship.Date)

# Convert to the Ship  and Order Dates to date
eastData$Order.Date <- as.Date(eastData$Order.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")
eastData$Ship.Date <- as.Date(eastData$Ship.Date, format = "%m/%d/%Y")

```

```{r}
# Create a consistent column numbers with only useful columns
ncol(centralData)
#View(centralData)
ncol(westData)
#View west data
ncol(eastData)
#View east data

# Add  Region column to central data
centralData$Region <- "Central"

# Rename the Products and Discounts so the column names is consistent all the regions
centralData <- rename(centralData, Product.Name = Product)
centralData <- rename(centralData, Discount = Discounts)
ncol(centralData)

# East Region has some inconsistency on the Sales column, we'll need to remove the USD to remain with the numeric values only
eastData$Sales <- as.numeric(str_replace(eastData$Sales, "USD", ""))
head(eastData$Sales,2)
ncol(eastData)

# Let's select the 21 variables in both east and central region to make up the west region data
westData <- westData %>%
  select(Row.ID, Order.ID, Customer.ID, Customer.Name, Segment,Country, City, Right_State2,
         Postal.Code, Product.ID, Category, Sub.Category, Product.Name, Sales, Quantity, Profit,
         Order.Date, Ship.Date, Ship.Mode, Discount, Region)
westData <- rename(westData, State = Right_State2)

# Save the new unique values for west data
nrow(westData)
westData <- unique(westData)

dim(westData)
```
```{r}
# Set a common top row index for all the datasets and merge the data ; we use the convention used for west data ,so we change only for east data and central data

order_c <- c("Row.ID", "Order.ID", "Customer.ID", "Customer.Name", "Segment","Country", "City", "State","Postal.Code","Product.ID","Category","Sub.Category","Product.Name","Sales","Quantity", "Profit","Order.Date", "Ship.Date", "Ship.Mode", "Discount", "Region")

centralData <- centralData[,order_c]
eastData <- eastData[,order_c]


# Merge the datasets
merged_set <- rbind(centralData, eastData, westData)
dim(merged_set)

merged_set <- merged_set%>%
  arrange(Row.ID)

head(merged_set)
View(merged_set)
```


```{r}
#Check for missing values in our merged dataset
any(is.na(merged_set))

# Replace all the empty rows with 1
merged_set <- merged_set[!apply(merged_set == '', 1, all),]

# Count the missing values in each column
colSums(is.na(merged_set))

# Remove all the missing values
merged_data <- na.omit(merged_set)
colSums(is.na(merged_data))
```

###QUESTION ONE

Which region on average, ships product faster ?

```{r}
# Average Days it take to ship

shipping_days <- merged_data %>%
  group_by(Region)%>%
  summarize(shipping_time = mean(Ship.Date - Order.Date))

shipping_days


```

Solution : On average East Region ships products faster (3.913 days on average)

# QUESTION TWO

Which products ship slowest by region ?

```{r}
product_shipment <- merged_data %>% 
  group_by(Region,Product.Name) %>% 
  summarize(avg_shipment_days = mean(Ship.Date-Order.Date))

# Central Region
central_slowest_shipping_products <- product_shipment %>%
  select(Product.Name,avg_shipment_days) %>%
  filter(Region == 'Central') %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_shipment_days))

head(central_slowest_shipping_products, 10)

# West Region
west_slowest_shipping_products <- product_shipment %>%
  select(Product.Name,avg_shipment_days) %>%
  filter(Region == 'West') %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_shipment_days))

head(west_slowest_shipping_products, 10)


# East Region
east_slowest_shipping_products <- product_shipment %>%
  select(Product.Name,avg_shipment_days) %>%
  filter(Region == 'East') %>%
  arrange(desc(avg_shipment_days))

head(east_slowest_shipping_products, 10)



```

# QUESTION 3

Plot time to ship by category, by year.


```{r}
merged_data$date_diff <- difftime(merged_data$Ship.Date, merged_data$Order.Date, units = "days")
merged_data$date_diff <- as.numeric(merged_data$date_diff)
merged_data <- merged_data[complete.cases(merged_data[, c('Category','date_diff')]),]

merged_data$Year <- format(merged_data$Ship.Date, format = "%Y")

ggplot(merged_data, aes(date_diff, Category, fill = Year)) + geom_boxplot() +
  stat_summary(fun = mean, geom = "point", col = "blue") + scale_fill_brewer(palette = "Dark5") +
  labs(x = "Days", y = "Category", title = "Time to ship by Category, and Year",
       subtitle = "(2015-2020)")

```

# QUESTION 4:

  select(Order.ID, Customer.Name, Product.Name, Region, Sales) %>%
  group_by(Region) %>%
  filter(Sales == max(Sales))
